💡 Sometimes, a simple "Hello, World!" is all you need to kickstart your journey.

🎓 What I Learned Along the Way 📘
🛠️ How to automate repetitive tasks using shell commands.

🔍 Debugging techniques to troubleshoot errors.

🌟 Creating real-world solutions for file management and system monitoring.

✨ Combining creativity with scripting for colorful and dynamic outputs!

🛠️ How to Run the Scripts 🚀
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/MAHALAKSHMImahalakshmi/autoShellRoboshop.git
cd autoShellRoboshop
Make the script executable (if not already):

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x <script-name>.sh
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo sh <script-name>.sh

💡 Using sudo ensures proper permissions, especially for scripts requiring root access.
